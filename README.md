"A macOS application to edit the ID3 tag of your mp3 files")

A macOS application to edit the ID3 tag of your mp3 files. You can download the application from [this link](https://github.com/chicio/Mp3ID3Tagger/raw/master/Release/Mp3ID3Tagger.dmg "Mp3ID3Tagger").

## Description

Mp3ID3Tagger support the following ID3 tag versions: 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4.
It will let you modify the following information inside the ID3 tag of you mp3 file:

* version of the tag
* title
* artist
* album
* year 
* track position
* genre
* attached picture set as Front cover

## Details

The application is entirely written in swift. It relays on a swift library I developed to edit ID3 tags of mp3 files: [ID3TagEditor](https://github.com/chicio/ID3TagEditor "ID3 tag editor").
The application has been built using [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift "RxSwift") and [RxCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/tree/master/RxCocoa "RxCocoa") as an experiment to apply the reactive programming paradigm in a real project.
The architectural pattern used to build the application is the [Model-View-ViewModel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel "model view viewmodel").  
Below you can find some screenshots of the app:
