"ID3TagEditor: A swift library to read and modify ID3 Tag of any mp3 file")

A swift library to read and modify ID3 Tag of any mp3 file. 

***

### Installation

There are four ways to install ID3TagEditor in your project:

- manual installation
- framework 
- cocoapods
- Swift Package Manager (support for linux platform)

**Manual installation**

To manually install ID3TagEditor simply drag and drop all the file contained in the [Source](https://github.com/chicio/ID3TagEditor/tree/master/Source "Source") 
folder inside your project (except for the info.plist file).

**Framework**

ID3TagEditor is also available as a framework. You can follow the standard procedure to install a custom cocoa touch framework
(simply drag the ID3TagEditor.xcodeproj inside your project and add it to the Embedded Binaries/Linked Frameworks and Libraries section of your
project. See the demo project for a complete example of the setup of the framework.

**CocoaPods**

ID3TagEditor is also available as a pod on [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/pods/ID3TagEditor "ID3TagEditor cocoapods").
Add the dependency to your Podfile (choose the release version you prefer):

```
target 'MyApp' do
    pod 'ID3TagEditor', '~> 2.0'
end
```

and then run pod install (or pod update).

**Swift Package Manager**

ID3TagEditor is also available as Swift Package for the Swift Package Manager. To use it simply add it to your dependecies in the Swift  `Package.swift`.
After that you can build your project with the command `swift build`, and eventually run you project (if it is an executable type) with the command `swift run`.
If you want you can also run tests using `swift test`.  
  
  *IMPORTANT: at the moment some tests are excluded from  `swift test` because some test api are missing (eg. `XCTestExpectation`) or 
because the Bundle of resources in the test target doesn't work as expected.* 

```
// swift-tools-version:4.2

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "Your App",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/chicio/ID3TagEditor.git", from: "2.2.0"),
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "Your App",
            dependencies: ["ID3TagEditor"]),
    ]
)
```

### Usage

ID3Tag editor is compatible with the following platforms:

* iOS
* MacOS
* Apple Watch
* Apple TV
* Linux Ubuntu

To read the ID3 tag of an mp3 file you can choose between two api contained in the `ID3TagEditor` class:
* `public func read(from path: String) throws -> ID3Tag?`
* `public func read(mp3: Data) throws -> ID3Tag?`

Below you can find a sample code of the api usage.

```swift
do {
    let id3TagEditor = ID3TagEditor()

    if let id3Tag = try id3TagEditor.read(from: "<valid path to the mp3 file>") {
        ...use the tag...
    }
    
    if let id3Tag = try id3TagEditor.read(mp3: "<valid mp3 file passed as Data>") {
        ...use the tag...
    }    
} catch {
    print(error)
}  
```

To write a new ID3 tag into an mp3 file you can choose between two api contained in the `ID3TagEditor` class:
* `public func write(tag: ID3Tag, to path: String, andSaveTo newPath: String? = nil) throws`
* `public func write(tag: ID3Tag, mp3: Data) throws -> Data`

Below you can find a sample code of the api usage.

```swift
do {
    let id3Tag = ID3Tag(
        version: .version3,
        artist: "an example artist",
        albumArtist: "an example album artist",
        album: "an example album",
        title: "an example title",
        recordingDateTime: RecordingDateTime(date: RecordingDate(day: 1, month: 10, year: 2019), 
                                             time: RecordingTime(hour: 14, minute: 30)),
        genre: Genre(genre: .ClassicRock, description: "Rock & Roll"),
        attachedPictures: AttachedPicture(picture: <NSData/Data of the image>, type: .FrontCover, format: .Jpeg),
        trackPosition: TrackPositionInSet(position: 2, totalTracks: 9)
    )
    
    try id3TagEditor.write(tag: id3Tag, to: "<valid path to the mp3 file that will be overwritten>"))
    try id3TagEditor.write(tag: id3Tag, 
                           to: "<valid path to the mp3 file>",
                           andSaveTo: "<new path where you want to save the mp3>"))
    let newMp3: Data = try id3TagEditor.write(tag: id3Tag, mp3: <valid mp3 file passed as Data>)                          
} catch {
    print(error)
}    
```  

The above methods use the `ID3Tag` class to describe a valid ID3 tag. This class contains various properties that could be
used to read/write a tag to the mp3 file.
Three versions of the tag are supported. They are described in the `ID3Version` enum:

* version 2.2, described by the enum value `.version2`  
* version 2.3, described by the enum value `.version3`  
* version 2.4, described by the enum value `.version4`

The ID3 supported properties are:

* `version`, as previously described
* `artist`, as a string containing the name of the song's artists
* `albumArtist`, as a string containing additional info about the artists 
* `album`, as a string containing the album title
* `title`, as a string containing the title of the song
* `recordingDateTime`, as an object composed by two other properties:
    * `date` as a `RecordingDate` object with three fields:
        * `day`, as a number that represents the recording day 
        * `month`, as a number that represents the recording month
        * `year`, as a number that represents the recording year
    * `time` as a `RecordingTime` object with two fields:
        * `hour`, as a number that represents the recording hour
        * `minute`, as a number that represents the recording minute
* `trackPosition`, as a `TrackPositionInSet` object containing the position of the track in the recording and the total number of track in the recordings
* `genre`, as a `Genre` object containing the `ID3Genre` identifier and/or a `description` of the song's genre
* `attachedPictures`, as an array of `AttachedPicture` objects containing the `Data` of an image, the `ID3PictureType` and the `ID3PictureFormat`

Only the `version` field is mandatory. The other fields are optional.
The field `artist`,  `albumArtist`, `title` and `album` are encoded/saved using Unicode 16 bit string (as requested by specification). 
The library is also able to read text frame wrongly encoded with Unicode (for example recordingDateTime must always be a ISO88591 string).
